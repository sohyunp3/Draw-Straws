Draw Straws is the project that our PEARC21 team created for the hackathon. It lets people settle debates by making people choose from a set of straws.

## Draw Straws

The project uses JS, CSS, and html to create a fun atmosphere by using probability to make decisions in a new way. For example, first ask aloud, "Who wants to make tea?" Next, everybody involved will click "Generate straws!" Finally, the one who gets the shortest straw is, thus, the selected tea brewer.    


## Possible Opposition
Has this idea been used before? No, this is the only one existing on the web.

Why not use php? Because security was not our main goal and html itâ€™s easier to learn

## End Goal

Our success enables us to have fun and enjoy learning how to program. One way we plan to share our success is by using a percentage of our reward to restore sea habitats from plastic straw damage.
